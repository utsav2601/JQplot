Jqplot with According, showing multiple graphs on a single page. 

The File chart.js contains the code of 3 different graphs. jqplot.html is the html file which includes all the javascripts for the graphs, it also calls the functions in the chart.js to show different graphs. 


jquery.html uses the accordion ui for collapsible content. 
According then replots the graph depending upon the index of the <h3> tag selected. 

Please feel to try !
